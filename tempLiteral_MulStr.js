console.log("I am a String");
console.log("Satyam is \nawesome");//takes to next line
console.log(`Satyam

let a = 24;

console.log(`I am ${a}`);   //string interpolation->whenever you working with api , you have to basically define various endpoint so here we can directly pass is efficient
console.log("I am",a);
